# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine (paid) program. More specifically, we analyzed the review data to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Results 
 - There were 6,711 total reviews, with 6690 being non-Vine (not paid) reviews, and 21 being Vine (paid) reviews.

## Summary
After analyzing the dataset, there does not appear to be positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. There was a higher percentage of non-paid 5-star reviews than paid 5-star reviews. Additional stasticical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of the scores to could be performed to determine if there is positivity bias across all the star ratings and the overall product rating.
